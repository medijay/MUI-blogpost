Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were falling Monday, with the crypto sector's momentum still highly dependent on flows into exchange-traded funds.

Bitcoin has fallen 0.6% over the last 24 hours to $66,860. The largest cryptocurrency hit a record high near $74,000 in mid-March amid a surge of interest from new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) but its price has dropped since then.

"A new impetus is needed in purchases of ETFs to revitalize demand growth. Likewise, the growth of liquidity in stablecoins is still slow. A sustainable price rally is usually associated with an increase in stablecoin liquidity, which hasn't yet materialized," wrote Javier Molina, a market analyst at eToro, in a research note.

However, there was good news elsewhere in the crypto sector after a judge approved a wind-down plan for Genesis Global on Friday. The plan will pay back creditors about 77% of the same digital assets that they loaned to the cryptocurrency lender before its bankruptcy filing nearly 16 months ago.

Beyond Bitcoin, Ether — the second-largest crypto — was down 0.7% to $3,091. Smaller cryptos or altcoins also fell, with Cardano down 2.8% and Polygon dropping 2.3%. Dogecoin fell 1.8%.
